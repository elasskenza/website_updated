title: "The multiple dimensions of selection into employment"
excerpt: "** <u> Abstract: </u> ** A vast literature on gender wage gaps has examined the importance of selection into employ-
ment. However, most analyses have focused only on female labour force participation and
gaps at the median. The Great Recession questions this approach both because of the major
shift in male employment that it implied but also because women’s decisions to participate
seem to have been different along the distribution, particularly due to an “added worker
effect”. This paper uses the methodology proposed by Arellano and Bonhomme (2017) to
estimate a quantile selection model over the period 2007-2018. Using a tax and benefit mi-
crosimulation model, I compute an instrument capturing the male selection induced by the
crisis as well as female decisions: the potential out-of-work income. Since my instrument is
crucially determined by the welfare state, I consider three countries with notably different
benefit systems – the UK, France and Finland. My results imply different selection patterns
across countries and a sizeable male selection in France and the UK. Correction for selection
bias lowers the gender wage gap and, in most recent years, reveals an increasing shape of
gender gap distribution with a substantial glass ceiling for the three countries.
