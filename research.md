* Recent explanations of the gender wage gap emphasize the role of gender differences in job search, yet the role of household constraints remains underexplored. This paper uses French administrative data to investigate the importance of gender-specific decisions in the reservation wage gap, and specifically how household constraints shape women's reservation wage strategies. First, I assess the types of occupations that men and women apply for and the implications for the reservation wage gap. Using textual analysis, I create a novel dataset classifying occupations according to several characteristics related to temporal flexibility and job content. Quantile decomposition methods allow me to document an unequal gap in reservation wage, intensifying along the distribution, partially explained by gender biased choices in the amenities of the desired job. I then assess how a 2018 reform, which increased childcare benefits for single-parent households by 30%, influenced the reservation wage and job-search behaviour. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and spatial variation in childcare service availability, results indicate that the reduction in childcare costs led women to lower their reservation wage. I also find that more affordable access to flexible childcare increases the likelihood of targeting occupations requiring greater temporal flexibility and the desired maximum commute, thereby enabling them to secure more stable jobs upon re-employment.

### *[Male and female selection effects on gender wage gaps in three countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537124000022)*

##### Published at Labour Economics  - [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2024.102506](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2024.102506)

  * **Abstract:** A vast literature on gender wage gaps has examined the importance of selection into employment. However, most analyses have focused only on female labour force participation and gaps at the median. The Great Recession questions this approach because of the major shift in male employment that it implied. This paper uses the methodology proposed by Arellano and Bonhomme (2017) to estimate a quantile selection model over the period 2007–2018. Using a tax and benefit microsimulation model, I compute an instrument capturing both male and female decisions to participate in the labour market: the potential out-of-work income. Since my instrument is crucially determined by the welfare state, I consider three countries with notably different benefit systems – the UK, France and Finland. My results imply different selection patterns across countries and a sizeable male selection in France and the UK. Correction for selection bias lowers the gender wage gap and reveals a substantial glass ceiling with different magnitudes. Findings suggest that disparities between these countries are driven by occupational segregation and public spending on families.

### *Gender gaps in the urban wage premium*
 With Cecilia García-Peñalosa (AMSE, CNRS, EHESS) & Christian Schluter (AMSE)

  * **Abstract:** In France, the gender wage gap for the 20% of the workforce living in the densest locations is 22% lower than that for those living in the bottom 20% of the density distribution, indicating that women benefit more from urban density than men. This paper explores the importance of geographical location for understanding the gender wage gap. Following the recent literature on economic geography that takes into account the endogeneity of location, we estimate the difference in the returns to urban density across genders. We build an exhaustive matched employer-employee panel database based on administrative data that allows us to follow almost all French workers during the period 2005-2019. Our results show that earnings increase with density for both men and women, with a significantly higher urban wage premium for women, which is about 55\% larger than for men. We consider different mechanisms that may explain this pattern, such as the difference in returns to experience, access to childcare facilities and the structure of the local labour market. Our findings suggest that these factors explain all of the gender gap in earnings from living in denser areas.

  * **Abstract:** With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- there has been a proliferation of websites offering CV generation services for job seekers, and CV screening services for employers. We study the use of LLMs to produce and screen CVs of job applicants. We run a series of online experiments inspired by classical correspondence studies. Three main findings emerge. First, leading open-source and closed-source models typically produce gender-stereotyped CVs. Second, they discriminate against women. Third, consistent with theories of systemic discrimination, the bias against women increases if the models are used to produce and screen applicant packages.
